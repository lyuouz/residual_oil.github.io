## Background

The project is based on the NYC Clean Heat Program. See [link](https://www.nyccleanheat.org/) here.

These are the fuel oil that are of interest, including #2, #4 and #6, higher numbers means the oil is more dirty and produces more air pollutants.

## Data Source

To model the impact of fuel conversion on air pollutants, these data were used in the analysis:

### New York City Air Community Survey (NYCCAS)

Air pollution data in New York City were obtained from [NYCCAS](http://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/NYCCAS-Air-Pollution-Rasters/q68s-8qxv), which were raster files containing annual average predicted surface of air pollutants at 300 m resolution. Annual average PM2.5 and winter average SO2 were used because they were thought to be the major pollutants from heating oil combustion. 

*  PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations were averaged at the census tract level using zonal statistics, resulting in 2167 data points.  
*  The absolute and relative difference between concentrations in 2011 and 2016 were used as the outcome variables in the model.  
*  Because the NYC Clean Heat Program was enforced in 2012, data in these two years served as comparison before and after policy implementation. 

### Residual oil conversion

The data comes from Mayor's Office.
